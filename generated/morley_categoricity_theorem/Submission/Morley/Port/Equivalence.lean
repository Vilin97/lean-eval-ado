# Equivalence of formulas over the constant expansion

This module mirrors `Mathlib.ModelTheory.Equivalence` under the same module name, recording how
semantic consequence `⟹[T]` and semantic equivalence `⇔[T]` between formulas commute with the
syntactic translation `Formula.equivSentence` into the constant expansion `L[[α]]`: a formula-level
implication (resp. equivalence) over `T` holds exactly when the corresponding sentences over the
expanded theory `(L.lhomWithConstants α).onTheory T` hold.

These statements are intended to be upstreamed to `Mathlib.ModelTheory.Equivalence`, after which
this module can be removed and its imports redirected.

## TODO

- Generalize the underlying validity transport from formulas to bounded formulas.  For
  `φ : L.BoundedFormula α n`, first pass to `φ.toFormula`, whose free-variable context is
  `α ⊕ Fin n`, and then apply `Formula.equivSentence`.  The resulting theorem should identify
  `T ⊨ᵇ φ` with validity of the translated sentence over the constant expansion by
  `α ⊕ Fin n`; bounded-formula versions of the implication and equivalence theorems should be
  derived from this single result.
- Extend binary semantic consequence to consequence from a set `Γ : Set (L.Formula α)`.  Under
  `Formula.equivSentence`, consequence from `Γ` over `T` should correspond to sentence consequence
  from `Formula.equivSentence '' Γ` together with `(L.lhomWithConstants α).onTheory T`.  The
  implication theorem above is the singleton-antecedent case.
- Package `Formula.equivSentence` as an equivalence of the semantic preorders determined by
  `Theory.Imp`.  It should descend through `Theory.iffSetoid` to an equivalence of formulas modulo
  semantic equivalence and, once the relevant quotient API exists, to an isomorphism of the
  corresponding Lindenbaum--Tarski Boolean algebras.
- Investigate the analogous transport along a general language homomorphism.  Reducts give the
  forward preservation direction, whereas reflection requires an expansion-lifting hypothesis
  (available, for example, for suitable injective language maps); this extra hypothesis should be
  explicit rather than built into a theorem about arbitrary language homomorphisms.
