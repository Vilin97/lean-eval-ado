# Additional Results on Elementary Maps

This file extends `Mathlib.ModelTheory.ElementaryMaps` with cardinality results for formula fibers.
Its declarations are intended to migrate directly to `Mathlib/ModelTheory/ElementaryMaps.lean`,
primarily in the `FirstOrder.Language.ElementaryEmbedding` namespace.

## Main results

- `ElementaryEmbedding.realizations_embedding`: embed the source realization subtype into the
  corresponding target realization subtype by sending a tuple `x` to `e ∘ x`.
- `ElementaryEmbedding.mk_realizations_le`: the resulting `Cardinal.mk` inequality, with no
  finiteness assumption on the tuple index type.
- `ElementaryEmbedding.encard_realizations_eq_coe_iff`: preservation and reflection of exact
  natural-number cardinality of a formula fiber.
- `ElementaryEmbedding.infinite_realizations_iff`: source and target realization sets are infinite
  simultaneously.

## Implementation order

1. Use `ElementaryEmbedding.map_formula` and pointwise injectivity of `e` to build the realization
   subtype embedding.
2. Apply `Cardinal.mk_le_of_injective` to prove cardinal monotonicity. This is the interface needed
   for arbitrary infinite-cardinal lower bounds.
3. Apply `ElementaryEmbedding.map_formula` to `Formula.iExsExactly`, then rewrite with
   `Formula.realize_iExsExactly` to prove preservation of exact finite cardinality.
4. Prove the equivalence of infinitude. One direction uses cardinal monotonicity, while the other
   argues contrapositively from preservation of exact finite cardinality.

Formulas in `L[[A]]` should be converted with `BoundedFormula.constantsVarsEquiv` and then passed
to the explicit-parameter API with parameter map `(↑) : A → M`. This is also the representation
provided by `Set.definable_iff_exists_formula_sum`, so no parallel constants-language API is needed.

## Cardinality boundary

Use `Set.encard` only for statements comparing a realization set with a natural number. Use
`Cardinal.mk` for monotonicity and for transporting arbitrary infinite-cardinal lower bounds,
because `Set.encard` identifies all infinite cardinalities with `⊤`.

/-- The embedding of realization subtypes induced by an elementary embedding.

`e` as well. No finiteness assumption on `α` is needed for this construction. -/

/-- Cardinality of a formula fiber cannot decrease under an elementary embedding.

This uses `Cardinal.mk`, rather than `Set.encard`, so that it retains information about arbitrary
infinite cardinalities. -/
